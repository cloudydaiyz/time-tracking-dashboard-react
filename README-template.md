## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- How to deploy a React.js application as a static website on GitHub Pages using Vite ([source](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages))
- Going from imperative functionality in JS (and some declarative in HTML and CSS) to complete declaritive functionality in React.js is a bit greater transition than I thought it'd be
- For files in the public folder, use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` instead of `/` as the root directory, as `vite.config.ts` can change your root directory.
